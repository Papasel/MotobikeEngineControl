This project gives you the possibility to start the engine of your Motobike with your android phone via bluetooth.
For this project i used arduino uno, bluetooth shield(hc05) and 2 relays for arduino.
It's very important to take care with the time delay from every engine separately because every engine reacts with different way and maybe will be destructive a probably wrong delay.
